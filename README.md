# Password-Generator-Overview:
This C program creates a random password of a specified length, ranging from 8 to 64 characters, and assesses its strength. The generatePassword function constructs a password by combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The evaluatePasswordStrength function verifies the inclusion of these character types and checks that the password meets the minimum length requirement of 8 characters, categorizing it as either "Strong" or "Weak." The main function manages user input, invokes the password generation and evaluation functions, and presents the results.
